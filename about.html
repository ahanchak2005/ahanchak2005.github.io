            <p>
                In the grand scheme of things, my tiny existence should not matter much, though I feel an intro is polite. 
                I identify as a human being, male variant, with moderately myopic eyes. I reside in Khardah, 
                though am delocalized between Khardah and Baranagar currently, both being small towns in the suburbs near 
                Kolkata (many Baranagar people will argue with me for calling Baranagar a suburb area, but whatever). The pronunciation of my name is tricky, in Bengali the name is অহন with spelling Ahan in English where the first A is like Aw and the second A is like O so, you should call me "Awhon".
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am mostly taciturn and hate talking much, but you would hardly get that if you saw me with people I am 
                comfortable with. <em>Hence, be careful about the inference!</em> 
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, academically I am a second-year B.Stat student at ISI Kolkata, and my academic interests mostly lie in:
            </p>
            
            <ul class="boxed-list">
                <li>Probability Theory</li>
                <li>Random Graphs</li>
                <li>Statistical Learning</li>
                <li>Mathematical Statistics</li>
                <li>Measure Theory</li>
                <li>Combinatorics</li>
                <li>Game Theory</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I sometimes teach Mathematics regularly, though don't like teaching at all to be honest. As a student too, I did not like the idea of someone guiding me to think in his/her own way not giving me enough space and time to think myself.  In my free time, 
                I enjoy listening to music, singing (a lot), chatting with my friends (<strong>A LOT</strong>), 
                watching movies, reading fictions, travelling and taking photographs, learning languages (am learning Italian currently) 
                and mostly sitting in a desolate place on ISI campus alone, talking to myself.

        <div class="colored-box">
            <strong>Where to find me:</strong> 
            If you come to ISI on Sundays around 2-3 pm, or about 12 noon during summer or winter vacation, 
            you may find me at the ghat beside the temple or on the stairs of the new buildings beside Amrapali 
            with a <strong>non-zero probability</strong>.
        </div>

        <p>
            That's quite a lot about me and almost everything about me that I want to share. 
            Thank you for reading by wasting your time!
