    <h1>Some rant about CV</h1>
    As a person, I have a lot of personal opinions which might not matter to any other person but personally they matter to me and this being my very personal web-site, writing those here should not hurt. Personally I feel numbers are not good estimates of one's skill and CVs are somewhat biased towards marks. However, I can't think of judging one's academic skillfulness in some other way than marks in some form. Whatever, enough spam.
